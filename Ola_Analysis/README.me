# 🚖 OLA Analysis - SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes ride booking data using SQL queries to extract key insights. It includes data on **successful bookings, canceled rides, top customers, ride distances, ratings, and payment methods.** Several **SQL Views** are created for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
